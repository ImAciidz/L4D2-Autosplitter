# L4D2-Autosplitter

This is an updated version of bill_play3's autosplitter for Left 4 Dead 2.

This features multiple improvements over the original, such as:
1. Support for The Last Stand update
2. Support for an extra old version so people are more inclined to try out the original Cold Stream ðŸ˜Ž
3. A fix for the autosplitter double splitting on certain finales (primarily the Parish)
4. Some extra QoL fixes (such as the ability to split on the Cold Stream finale while playing RocketDude)

To use this in LiveSplit, do the following:

1. Right click, hit edit splits
2. Disable the integrated autosplitter if you have it active, and click OK
3. Right click, hit edit layout
4. Click on the giant plus and go to Control > Scriptable Auto Splitter
5. Double click on the newly added Scriptable Auto Splitter component
6. Click "Browse" and select the downloaded ASL file
7. If done correctly, the autosplitter's settings will show and everything should function
